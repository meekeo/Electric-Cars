    <h1> Electric Cars</h1>
    <p style="font-size:100%;"> Electric cars tend to be much quieter than gas vehicles. That noise reduction can improve 
        performance and quality of life and lead to a smooth ride on the road. Electric vehicles tend to be more energy ef
        ficient in stop-and-go traffic as well and electric motors actually react faster than mechanical engines. All of these
         factors combined make for a better performance and experience as both a driver and passenger. the estimates the average
          EV battery pack's lifespan to be at around 200,000 miles, which is nearly 17 years of use if driven 12,000 miles per year.</p>
